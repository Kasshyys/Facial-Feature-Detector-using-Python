#🧠 Face, Eye & Smile Detection using OpenCV
This Python project uses Haar Cascade Classifiers from OpenCV to detect faces, eyes, and smiles in a static image.

👁️ Multi-scale object detection

🖼️ Image processing with grayscale conversion

📍 Region of Interest (ROI) based feature extraction

✅ Implemented using pre-trained models

👁️ Real-time Facial Feature Detection

📸 Face, Eye, and Smile Detection using Haar Cascade Classifiers

🧠 Object Detection with Pre-trained Models

💡 Practical Application of Haar Cascades in Python

🧪 Detection Logic: Multi-scale detection, Grayscale Conversion

🖼️ Image Input-Based Detection (vs Webcam)
